Classifying images of fruits using deep learning with pytorch

In this project, I did Image Classification on the Fruits 360 dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits) by building a deep learning model from 
scratch. This dataset contains a total of nearly 90,000 images of different fruits and vegetables out of which nearly 67,000 are training images and 22,000 are test images. There 
are 131 different categories of fruits and vegetables which are to be classified. All the images are 100x100 pixel images in .jpg format.
